# Copy this file to `.env.local` for local development and replace the placeholder with your real key.
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit `.env.local` with real keys.

# Gemini API key used by local development (Vite env vars must start with VITE_)
# Example:
# VITE_GEMINI_KEY=YOUR_LOCAL_GEMINI_KEY

# Optional: if you prefer the server-only approach, leave this blank and use the Functions proxy.
# For production, set the key on the server (Functions config or env) â€” do NOT expose it as a VITE_ prefixed var.
